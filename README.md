Exploring mangrove ecosystem function post-hurricane disturbance by analyzing changes in both behavior and community structure.

## Project Description
Dr. Michelle Fournet and MS student Jill Munger of University of New Hampshire are working in Tortola, British Virgin Islands from in 2024 to explore the possibility of using passive acoustic monitoring to assess restoration efforts and biodiversity in three island ecosystems: (1) to assess marine ecological communities (fish and invertebrates) in mangrove systems, post-disturbance from Hurricane Irma in 2017. This work is being done in collaboration with H. Lavity Stoutt Community College and Dr. Gregg Moore, Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at University of New Hampshire.
The data were collected from 4 field sites (2 healthy, 1 restored, 1 disturbed) from a variety of acoustic sensors (SoundTrap 300 & 400, HydroMoths). Ancillary data was collected using a YSI probe and HOBO loggers.
